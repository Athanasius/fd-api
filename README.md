*This is a work in progress.  The master branch now has working code,
but for the latest check if the fdev-oauth2 branch is ahead.*

See [documentation](docs/README.md) for details on how this all works,
including a walk-through for how to handle the oAuth2 flow yourself.

See [TODO](docs/TODO.md) for what is/isn't implemented.

The main script is 'fd-ed-capi.py' so run:

                fd-ed-capi.py --help
to check the options.

This project is written in Python 3.x (tested on 3.7.x) and implements
the oAuth2 Authorization mechanism before allowing you to retrieve data
from the Companion API (CAPI) end points.
