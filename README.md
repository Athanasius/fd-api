**This is a work in progress.  The master branch now has working code,
but for the latest check if the fdev-oauth2 branch is ahead.**

See [TODO](docs/TODO.md) for what is/isn't implemented.  The main script
is 'fd-ed-capi.py' so run:

                fd-ed-capi.py --help
to check the options.

This project is written in Python 3.x (tested on 3.5.x) and implements
the oAuth2 Authorization mechanism before allowing you to retrieve data
from the Companion API (CAPI) end points.

See docs/ directory for details on how it works.
