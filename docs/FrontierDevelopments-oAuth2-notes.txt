=Introduction=
  Since early 2019 Frontier Developments switched authorisation for
their CAPI (Companion API)[0] service from plain username+password to an
oAuth2 scheme.
  Before a developer can make any use of this they must first apply for
access.

 1. Navigate a web browser to <https://user.frontierstore.net/> and
 *apply* for access (I can't more fully document this because I long
 since went through the process and only have one applicable account).

 2. Once Frontier have *approved* your access (it will _not_ be
 instant), navigate back to <https://user.frontierstore.net/> to review
 the available information.  You should default to the 'User
 Information' view which shows:

  a. Frontier ID - your unique ID for this system
  b. Name - The real name specified in your account
  c. Email - The email address associated with your account
  d. Platform - Whether this is a Frontier account, XBox, Playstation or
  Steam.

  The 'Authorized Applications' lists all the applications you've
  authorised to request data on your behalf.  This might include sites
  like Inara.Cz.

 3. The 'Developer Zone' is where you'll see your authorised application
 once access is granted.  You will probably have 'AUTH' and 'CAPI'
 scopes.  Clicking 'View' on this will reveal your Client ID and Shared
 Key.  You can also 'Regenerate key' here if you ever need to.

  There is also a link to <https://user.frontierstore.net/developer/docs>,
 the developer documentation.  If you are wanting to use CAPI with a
 standalone application, rather than a web-based application you will
 need to follow the PKCE documentation.
  
[0] - It's called CAPI / Companion API because it was originally created
solely for the use of an authorised, third-party developed, Companion
application for iOS (an Android version was never produced).  Although
that application is long since dead (not working on many subsequent iOS
revisions), enough developers figured out the API and started making use
of it that Frontier Developments decided to continue supporting it.
