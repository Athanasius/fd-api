You will need to store and send cookies for the authentication to work.
One of these cookies is marked 'discard', so you shouldn't store it
persistently.  However if you do then you won't need to perform the
login step each time, instead being able to go straight to step #3.

Also, the way I use the API relies on handling HTTP redirects myself.
If you use a library that automatically follows the redirects you'll
likely get confused by this guide.  In step #1 below rather than seeing
the 302 you'd instead get a 200 and the contents of the login form.

First you need to retrieve the base URL to check if the system needs you
to login or if your current cookies are good.

1) GET https://companion.orerve.net

  Now check the HTTP response code.  If it's a 302 (redirect) to /user/login
  then you need to supply email and password to the form there.
  If it's just a 200 (OK) then you're set.

2) POST https://companion.orerve.net/user/login

  You need to send data: email=<email>&password=<password>
  i.e. email=flibble@example.org&password=supersecure

  Again, check the HTTP response code.  If it's a 302 to '/' you're
  done and can now query the profile.

  However if it's a 302 to '/user/confirm' then you need to supply the
  auth code from email.

  POST https://companion.orerve.net/user/confirm
  code=<confirmation code>
  
  Check Response code, if it's 302 to '/' you're good to go.

  If the code isn't recognised you'll get a 200 HTTP response as it
  wants to simply show you the HTML form to try again and you're already
  'on' that URL.
   
3) Retrieve the commander profile:

   GET https://companion.orerve.net/profile

   You should get a 200 (OK) HTTP response.  If not then the system
   still doesn't think you're logged in.

   The data is returned as a JSON object.  An example can be found at:

4) If you want to logout/de-authenticate then simply delete all cookies
for the site.  I've found no method to TELL the FD server to forget
about a particular auth.  There may be one, after all it would match
what 'Logout Machine' on the launcher 'Options' menu does.
