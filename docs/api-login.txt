You will need to store and send cookies for the authentication to work.

First you need to retrieve the base URL to check if the system needs you
to login or if your current cookies are good.

1) GET https://companion.orerve.net

  Now check the HTTP response code.  If it's a 302 (redirect) to /user/login
  then you need to supply email and password to the forum there.
  If it's just a 200 (OK) then you're set.

2) POST https://companion.orerve.net/user/login

  You need to send data: email=<email>&password=<password>
  i.e. email=flibble@example.org&password=supersecure

  Again, check the HTTP response code.  If it's a 302 to '/' you're
  done and can now query the profile.

  However if it's a 302 to '/user/confirm' then you need to supply the
  auth code from email.

  POST https://companion.orerve.net/user/confirm
  code=<confirmation code>
  
  Check Response code, if it's 302 to '/' you're good to go.

  If the code isn't recognised you'll get a 200 HTTP response as it
  wants to simply show you the HTML form to try again and you're already
  'on' that URL.
   
3) Retrieve the commander profile:

   GET https://companion.orerve.net/profile

   You should get a 200 (OK) HTTP response.  If not then the system
   still doesn't think you're logged in.

   The data is returned as a JSON object.  An example can be found at:
